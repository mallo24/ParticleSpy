# Development of a dashboard to visualize nanoparticle analysis from a transmission electron microscope (ParticleSpy Dashboard).
# Dissertation Summary
<br /> In this project, I developed a dashboard to display analysis results from the ParticleSpy python package. The dashboard included flexible plotting of different physical parameters, and display of images from the microscope. The aim is for the dashboard to process images live, as they are obtained by the microscope, and display live updates during a microscope session.
# Objectives:
<br />1- Linking the ParticleSpy functionalities to the dashboard.
<br />1.1- Particle segmentation (image segmentation).
<br />1.2- Particle analysis.
<br />2- Providing interactive features between elements.
<br />3- Enable the dashboard to update automatically upon the detection of an acquired image landing in a directory.
